# TypeScript Fixes for Crypto Dashboard

## Issues Fixed

1. Fixed error handling in TypeScript by properly typing caught errors:
   - When catching errors, TypeScript treats them as `unknown` type by default
   - We've added proper type checking with `e instanceof Error` before accessing `.message` property
   - Added fallbacks like `'Unknown error'` for cases where the caught value isn't an Error object

2. Added proper interface typing for dynamic object properties:
   - Used index signatures `[key: string]: number` to allow for dynamic keys in scope object
   - This fixed the TypeScript error with dynamic property assignment

3. Fixed font weight TypeScript issues in chart configuration:
   - Changed font weight from numeric strings like `'600'` to valid values like `'bold'`
   - Added `as const` type assertions where needed

## How to Test the Fixes

Run the local build script to verify all TypeScript errors have been fixed:

```bash
./build-local.bat
```

The build should now complete successfully without any TypeScript errors.

## Deployment Next Steps

After verifying the build succeeds locally, you can:

1. Commit the changes to your repository
2. Push to GitHub
3. Deploy to Netlify following the instructions in DEPLOYMENT.md

All TypeScript errors should now be resolved, allowing for successful deployment.
