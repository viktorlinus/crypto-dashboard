Certainly! Here's a comprehensive explanation of your crypto dashboard project, including both the original features and the new additions we've built today:

## Crypto Dashboard Project Overview

### Core Features
Your project is a Next.js-based cryptocurrency dashboard that fetches and displays real-time data for various cryptocurrencies. It's built with TypeScript and uses Supabase as the backend database.

**Key Features**:
1. **Real-time Cryptocurrency Data**: Displays prices, market caps, and trading volumes
2. **Interactive Charts**: Using Chart.js and react-chartjs-2 with multiple Y-axes
3. **Multiple Coin Selection**: Allows selecting up to 5 coins to compare
4. **Customizable Time Ranges**: 7D, 1M, 3M, 6M, 1Y, and All options
5. **Different Data Views**: Toggle between prices, market caps, and volumes
6. **Logarithmic Scale Toggle**: For comparing coins with large price differences
7. **Statistics Cards**: Shows current values and percentage changes

**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, Next.js
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
- **Data Storage**: Supabase
- **API Integration**: Using CoinGecko API (with a Python script for data collection)

**Data Flow**:
1. A Python script (`top100_supabase.py`) fetches cryptocurrency data from CoinGecko and stores it in Supabase
2. The Next.js app fetches data from Supabase via API endpoints
3. The UI components render the data with proper formatting and visualization

### Recent Additions and Improvements

#### 4. Y-Axis Visualization Mode Toggle
We introduced a flexible Y-axis visualization mode to enhance comparative analysis:

- **Dynamic Y-Axis Switching**:
  - Added a toggle to switch between multiple and single Y-axis modes
  - Implemented in the `PriceChart` and `AxisModeToggle` components
  - Allows users to choose between individual and shared axis views

- **Multiple Y-Axis Mode**:
  - Each cryptocurrency gets its own scaled Y-axis
  - Ideal for comparing coins with significantly different value ranges
  - Color-coded axes matching the respective coin's line color

- **Single Y-Axis Mode**:
  - All cryptocurrencies plotted on a single, shared axis
  - Enables direct visual comparison of coin values
  - Helpful for comparing relative changes and trends

- **User Experience Improvements**:
  - Intuitive toggle switch with clear visual feedback
  - Tooltip explaining the difference between axis modes
  - Seamless switching between visualization modes

#### 5. Enhanced Metric Data Handling and Chart Rendering
We improved the metric data processing and chart rendering to address data inconsistencies:

- **Robust Metric Data Formatting**:
  - Enhanced `formatMetricDataForChart` function in `metricEvaluator.ts`
  - Improved handling of coins with incomplete or missing metric data
  - Ensures all selected coins are represented in the chart
  - Gracefully handles null or undefined values

- **Debugging and Logging Improvements**:
  - Added comprehensive console logging for metric calculation
  - Implemented more detailed error tracking and data validation
  - Improved data preparation and metric evaluation processes

- **Y-Axis and Coin Display Enhancements**:
  - Modified chart rendering to support coins added mid-analysis
  - Implemented fallback mechanisms for coins with partial data
  - Maintained chart consistency across different coin selections

#### Known Limitations and Future Improvements
- There is still a potential rendering glitch when adding or removing coins from the chart
- Future work will focus on further stabilizing the dynamic coin selection and metric calculation process

### Previous Additions

#### 1. Historical Coin Tracking System
We enhanced the data collection and storage system to track coins even after they fall out of the top 100:

- **New Database Tables**:
  - `tracked_coins`: Stores information about all coins we're tracking
  - `crypto_rankings`: Stores daily rankings of coins

- **Modified Python Script**:
  - Records daily rankings in the `crypto_rankings` table
  - Tracks which coins are currently in the top 100 vs. historical coins
  - Updates the `last_in_top100` date for existing coins
  - Fetches data for both current top 100 and recently relevant historical coins

- **Enhanced API Endpoints**:
  - Updated to accept a `scope` parameter with values 'current' or 'all'
  - Returns either current top 100 coins or all tracked coins
  - Ensures data continuity for historical analysis

- **UI Updates**:
  - Added toggle buttons for switching between current and all tracked coins
  - Clear status indicator showing which scope is active

#### 2. Multiple Y-Axes Chart Enhancement
We improved the chart visualization to make it easier to compare cryptocurrencies with vastly different price ranges:

- **Individual Y-Axes**: Each cryptocurrency now has its own Y-axis with an appropriate scale
- **Color Coordination**: Each axis is colored to match its corresponding cryptocurrency line
- **Enhanced Tooltip**: Shows percent change information from the first value in the selected time range
- **Custom Scales**: Automatic scaling based on each coin's min/max values

#### 3. Metrics Workbench
We created a powerful workbench for building custom metrics:

- **New Components**:
  - `MetricBuilder`: UI for creating custom metrics using formulas
  - `MetricsWorkbench`: Manages saved metrics and provides the workbench interface
  - `metricEvaluator`: Backend library for calculating custom metrics

- **Formula System**:
  - Support for basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  - Mathematical functions (sqrt, log, abs)
  - Combinations of different metrics (price, volume, market cap)

- **Data Persistence**:
  - Custom metrics are saved to localStorage
  - Can be referenced across sessions
  - Support for formula descriptions and documentation

- **Visualization**:
  - Custom metrics get their own chart view
  - Clear labeling and information display
  - Toggleable between standard data and custom metrics

### Implementation Details

#### Historical Tracking
1. The system tracks when coins enter and exit the top 100
2. Data continuity is maintained for coins that drop out of rankings
3. A smart 30-day cutoff prevents unlimited growth of tracked coins

#### Chart Enhancement
1. Each cryptocurrency has its own appropriately scaled Y-axis
2. Visual improvements make it easier to see relative price movements
3. Color coordination makes it intuitive to match lines with their scales

#### Metrics Workbench
1. Formula builder with dropdown selectors for metrics and operations
2. Preview of calculation results before saving
3. Management interface for saved metrics
4. Integration with the main chart system

This comprehensive system gives you a powerful tool for cryptocurrency analysis, combining real-time data with historical context and customizable analytics.
